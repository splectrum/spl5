# Spawn Process

Steps discovered during spl4 → spl5 transition.
Prototype for the spawn protocol.

## Sequence

1. Critical review of current iteration
2. Write FOUNDATION.md — refined understanding,
   base layer for seed
3. Walk through foundation interactively
4. Build seed using foundation as lens:
   a. Pillar documentation — refine knowledge base
   b. Top-level documentation — frame with refined pillars
   c. Project extraction — catalog deployed protocols,
      group for dev env repos
   d. Initial memory — CLAUDE.md only. Task memory and
      session memory start empty, populated when work
      begins.
   e. Review as reference — fold into ORIGINS
5. Create install package from seed:
   a. Seed documentation (pillar docs, background,
      process, framing)
   b. All deployed protocol code (lock, stock and barrel)
   c. Boot infrastructure (wrapper, entry point, package.json)
   d. Project-scoped registrations
   e. Empty memory structure (.claude/rules/)
   f. Install instructions (manual for now)
6. Insert into new iteration (copy to new repo,
   chmod, init map, run tests, initial commit)

## Observations

- Review is interactive: discussion and extraction,
  not just writing
- Foundation document drives all subsequent work
- Bottom-up: substance first, then framing, then
  distillation, then orientation, then history
- The spawn process itself starts as POC
- Current memory influences focus — bloated memory
  nudges wrong direction, so memory must be rebuilt
  not carried forward
- Positioning requires landscape research — the world
  moves, check if your differentiation still holds
- Background docs are the foundational statement;
  pillar docs are the active, evolving expression
- Process docs serve two consumers (builder + evaluator),
  keep both formats
- Documentation types: background (origins, principles,
  positioning), logical (pillar docs), operational
  (process, patterns, protocols)
- Protocol code must be included in install — seed
  without working tools is just documentation
- Project extraction is about deployed protocols, not
  project summaries. What matters is working code
  grouped for dev env repos.
- Three memory tiers (persistent/task/session) map to
  context lifetimes, not specific files. Files are one
  delivery mechanism. For install: only persistent
  (CLAUDE.md) is seeded, rest starts empty.
- Context management (nutshell/select/weight/assemble)
  is the discover protocol's physical side — applies to
  all contexts, not just AI prompts
- Manual spawn first, protocol automates later. The
  first spawn is itself POC.
