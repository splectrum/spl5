# CLAUDE.md — Splectrum (spl5)

## What This Is

Splectrum is a structured environment for working with
meaning. Three pillars: Mycelium (data), Splectrum
(meaning), HAICC (creative action). Meaning is central
— data is shaped by meaning through creative action.

See `background/PRINCIPLES.md` for the full picture.

## Mission

spl5 is the pilot iteration. Its mission is to establish
standalone dev environments for protocols and implement
the spawn protocol — enabling repos to diversify from a
single embryonic codebase into autonomous, self-sufficient
repositories.

On completion: protocols develop in their own environments,
spawn produces autonomous repos from candidates, and the
hub repo oversees the wider picture.

## Lifecycle

POC → pilot → production, applied per concern.

spl4 was POC: discrete projects proving concepts. spl5
sets up pilot: proper dev environments, install workflows,
standalone repos. New capabilities still enter at POC
regardless of context maturity.

## Autonomy Target

Physical fully AI autonomous — structure, code,
environments, testing, deployment. Logical interactive
collaborative — scope, meaning, design, direction.

Collaboration on meaning is Splectrum's nature, not a
limitation.

## How We Work

- **Entity:** Any participant. Human, AI, process.
  No forced divisions.
- **Maximum beneficial autonomy:** If the system can
  do it, it should.
- **Technology decisions are AI's domain.** Don't
  defer, decide.
- **Build, don't plan endlessly.** If it's wrong, fix it.
- **Meaning first.** Everything starts from meaning and
  intent, not from infrastructure.
- **KISS.** Simplest mechanism that serves the purpose.

## The Build Cycle

AI decides what to build next, builds it, then we
evaluate together and evolve. Each iteration moves
some steps forward, not the whole distance.

## Scope

1. **Dev environments** — standalone protocol
   development with install, test, deploy workflow
2. **Spawn protocol** — analyze candidate, build
   install package, seed new autonomous repo
3. **Candidate development** — model/ as subrepo,
   governance during candidacy, autonomous on deploy
4. **Context management** — practical work with the
   three layers (nutshell, select/weight, assemble).
   Get a feel for discover's operation on real tasks.

Repo diversification will be embryonic in spl5.
Full discovery protocol is roadmap (not spl5).
Avro schemas are roadmap (not spl5).
