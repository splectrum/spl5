# Mycelium Model

Mycelium is a data interaction model. It defines how
data is structured, accessed, and behaved — independent
of where or how data is physically stored or transmitted.

## The Primitive

**Record** = key → content (opaque bytes).

**Context** = bounded area that contains data structures.
Records can themselves be contexts.

Keys are meaningful only within their containing context.
Content is opaque — the model does not interpret it.
Everything else (typing, hashing, references, meaning)
is layered above.

This primitive was proven sufficient across 18 projects
spanning storage, changelog, traversal, evaluation,
protocol architecture, and compound operations.
No extensions were required.

## Operations

| Operation | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| list | read | Keys in a context |
| read | read | Content of a record |
| create | write | New record |
| update | write | Overwrite existing record |
| del | write | Remove a record |
| move | compound | Relocate across contexts (read + create + del) |
| copy | compound | Duplicate across contexts (read + create) |

Compound operations compose from primitives. The
operation set is minimal and complete.

Flatten (all keys recursively) is derived from recursive
list, not a separate operation.

## Three Layers

**Logical** — Structures and operations. What exists
and what you can do with it. Zero dependency on storage
or substrate. Pure interface.

**Capability** — Binds logical to physical. Implements
the operations against a specific substrate. Multiple
capabilities are interchangeable — same behavior,
different backing.

**Physical** — The substrate itself. Folders and files.
A single JSON file. A database. An API. A network call.
The physical layer has no opinions — it is whatever the
capability wraps.

The storage capability has zero knowledge of metadata,
mutability, or behavior. It stores and retrieves bytes.
All intelligence lives in the context layer above.

## Context Layer

The context layer sits between the logical interface
and the storage capability. It provides:

**Traversal** — Walk the path from root to target. At
each segment, check for context definitions (metadata).
Merge into accumulator. Nearest distance wins — inner
context overrides outer.

**Flat contexts** — A context marked flat means "my
interior is content, not sub-contexts." Traversal hops
over physical structure to the resource directly.

**Metadata-driven behavior** — Mutability, changelog
mode, and enforcement are driven by metadata accumulated
during traversal. No flags, no configuration. Structure
is behavior.

**Metadata sources** — Transient (supplied at invocation)
and stored (persisted as records in contexts). Both feed
the same accumulation. Merge mode determines precedence
when they conflict.

## Changelog

**Sibling record** — Changelog for `foo` is
`foo.changelog`, a record in the same context. Visible,
readable, flattenable. Not hidden metadata.

**Three modes:**
- **none** — no tracking (default; most records)
- **resource-first** — resource is truth, log is audit
- **log-first** — log is truth, resource is derived

**Cascading** — A context's changelog aggregates its
children's changelogs. Derived, not stored.

**Delete behavior** — Depends on structure. If a bin
sub-context exists, delete moves there. If not, delete
is permanent. Structure determines behavior.

## Behavioral Principles

**Structure is behavior.** No flags, no configuration.
A context with a bin has soft delete. A flat context
skips interior traversal. A context with changelog mode
tracks changes. What you build is how it behaves.

**Nearest distance.** Definitions reside closest to
their realization. A context's metadata lives in that
context, not in a central registry. Inner overrides
outer.

**Data-triggered processing.** Data state drives
progression. Each step reads inputs from records, writes
outputs as records. Presence/absence determines what
happens next. Stateless steps, data as checkpoint.

**Resolution spectrum.** The same meaning at different
granularity: natural language (opaque) → structured file
(partially explicit) → individual records in contexts
(fully explicit). All the same primitive at different
resolution.

## Point of View

The working directory sets the **point of view** (POV).
POV determines two things: what you can see, and how you
identify it.

### Resources and Functionality

**Resources** — data you address and operate on — are
relative to POV. You can only see what is in front of
you. Paths go forward (into contexts below), never
backward (above POV). A path is always relative to the
current reference context.

**Functionality** — protocol operations, modules, the
proto map — is referenced to the repo root. Regardless
of where you stand, all registered operations are
available. You can use capabilities that live in the
hidden part of the tree.

This separation is structural: resources are scoped,
functionality is global. An entity in `projects/` can
invoke `evaluate/run` (functionality, root-registered)
on `14-bug-fixes` (resource, relative to POV) but
cannot address `../mycelium/model.md` (behind POV).

### Paths as Identity

Paths are primary keys. A key is meaningful only within
its containing context — this is already a model
primitive (§ The Primitive). POV extends this: the same
resource has different paths from different viewpoints.

From root: `projects/14-bug-fixes`
From projects/: `14-bug-fixes`

Both identify the same resource. The path is a
context-relative URI — a scalable primary key that
derives from position. Identity is not absolute; it is
always relative to a reference context.

### Cascading References

When a resource is behind POV but access is required,
**cascading references** bring it into view. A reference
is a record in the current context that points to a
resource elsewhere. The reference creates a local
identity (path) for a remote resource.

This means:
- A resource can have multiple identities — one per
  context that references it
- Each identity is a valid PK within its context
- References are the base level of permission: if you
  can see a reference, you can follow it
- No reference, no access — POV enforces the boundary

References cascade: a context can reference a context
that itself contains references. The graph of references
defines the reachable set from any POV.

### Implemented

- `doc.prefix` — POV as CWD relative to root
- `doc.resolvePath(path)` — resolve resource path from
  POV to absolute mc path, rejecting escapes
- Functionality paths (config.json module references)
  remain root-relative
- Resource paths in operator results are POV-relative

### Not Yet Implemented

- Cascading references (record type, traversal, graph)
- Multiple UUID identity per resource
- Reference-based permission model

## Real vs Virtual Contexts

A context is either real (physically present) or virtual
(defined by type, not yet instantiated).

- **Real** — exists physically. Has content, can be
  operated on.
- **Virtual** — defined in the parent's metadata as a
  candidate for instantiation. A type with config that
  isn't an instance yet.

Creating = making a virtual context real. The virtual
type in the parent determines what can be created. You
cannot create a real context where no virtual of that
kind exists.

A parent context declares its virtual children in
metadata. The `*` wildcard means any number of instances
of this virtual type can become real.

mc.xpath resolve returns real or error today. Virtual
comes when type definitions are wired up.

## Schemas (Direction)

Records are opaque bytes — schemas give those bytes a
contract. A schema is metadata on a context that describes
the shape of its records.

Graduated path:
1. Convention — implicit shapes (e.g. config.json fields)
2. Avro schemas as context metadata — co-located with
   the data they describe, stored as records
3. Avro RPC for protocol contracts — operations declare
   input/output schemas, wire protocol for client-server
4. Schema evolution — Avro compatibility rules for
   evolving structures without breaking consumers

avsc (pure JS Avro implementation) — proven in spl2.

## Physical Layer (Direction)

Current substrate: Node.js filesystem. Future: Bare
runtime for Pear P2P platform (Hypercore/Hyperbee as
storage, Hyperswarm for connectivity).

Transition from Node to Bare is mainly package.json
import maps for library switching. Current code uses
minimal Node built-ins (fs, path, url, crypto).

The three-layer model already anticipates this —
same logical model, different capability and physical
layers. Avro schemas enforce contracts over P2P wire
protocols (Bare + Hypercore + avsc).

## Scripting Semantics (Direction)

Seamless error handling at the logical scripting level.
No try/catch, no if/else. Error handling as expression
syntax:

    dosomething(mc.xpath(...)) or dosomethingelse()

The happy path and fallback are at the same syntactic
level. Errors propagate naturally through pipelines.
Fallbacks compose:

    do(x) or do(y) or do(z)

The "or" pattern is the fundamental error handling
primitive at the scripting level. This shapes API
design: operations that fail produce errors that flow
to the next alternative.

Designed, not yet built.
