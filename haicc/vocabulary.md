# Vocabulary

## Entity

Any participant — human, AI, process, sensor, tool.
No special cases. The same principles apply to all.

## Build Cycle

The rhythm of creation: decide what to build, build it,
evaluate the result, evolve understanding. Six steps:
decide, scope, require, build, test, evaluate. Each
cycle moves some steps forward, not the whole distance.

## Project

A context with a specific shape and lifecycle. Has
requirements, produces artifacts, gets evaluated.
Projects are numbered sequentially and become immutable
once sealed.

## Autonomy

Physical fully AI autonomous — structure, code,
environments, testing, deployment. Logical interactive
collaborative — scope, meaning, design, direction.
Collaboration on meaning is Splectrum's nature, not a
limitation.

## Iteration

A major cycle of work (spl3, spl4, spl5). Each iteration
has a mission, produces projects, and seeds the next
iteration when complete.

## Lifecycle

Three stages applied per concern, not per iteration:
POC (prove concepts), pilot (make operational), production
(mature and evolve). New capabilities enter at POC
regardless of context. Stages coexist — like organs
developing at different rates.

## Spawn

A context seeding a new context. Critical self-examination,
seed assembly, minimal preparation. The new context makes
its own structural decisions. Differentiation — the
system grows by diversifying, not by accumulating.

## Candidate

A context under development inside its parent (model/
as subrepo). Parent tooling shapes the candidate during
development. Governance during candidacy only — deploy
makes it autonomous.
