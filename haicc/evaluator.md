# Evaluator

Implementations are evaluated against their requirements
as a quality gate in the build cycle.

## Requirements

1. Natural language requirements serve as the basis for
   evaluation — no separate formal specification needed

2. Evaluation is entity-neutral — any entity that
   understands the language can evaluate

3. Each requirement is evaluated independently

4. The evaluation produces a clear fitness judgement per
   requirement, not just a general impression

5. The process is repeatable — same requirements and
   artifacts produce consistent evaluation
