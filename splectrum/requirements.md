# Requirements

Expressed intent for what should exist or how something
should behave. Natural language. Requirements are the
bridge between meaning and realization — they formalize
understanding into something that can be built against
and evaluated.

Requirements exist at different levels. Logical-level
requirements express intent without implementation
detail. Capability-level requirements bind that intent
to a specific realization. Both are natural language.
Both are evaluable.

Wherever requirements exist, evaluation is possible.
