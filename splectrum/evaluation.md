# Evaluation

Expressed meaning is evaluable against its intent.
Wherever requirements exist, fitness can be determined —
by any entity that understands the language, without
depending on the original creator.

Each requirement is evaluated independently. The
evaluation produces a clear fitness judgement per
requirement. The process is repeatable.
